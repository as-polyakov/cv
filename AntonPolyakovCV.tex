        {Nordea Markets, Copenhagen, Denmark}
        {http://www.nordea.com}
        {Head of Market Risk IT}
        {Started as a crisis manager leading a team of 25 developers and business analysts.
        Risk valuation engines were seriously below SLAs, suffered from substantial capacity, stability and scalability issues, required extensive manual support due to lack of automated deployment processes. Development process was nontransparent, ineffective and key-man dependent.
        My goal was to bring systems back to SLA, (re) engineer  systems, bringing in
        engineering culture, building strong development practice, ensuring agile and transparent development
        processes.\\*
        Achieved results:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item{identified the most problematic hot spot areas and developed an evolutionary strategy to stabilize and re-engineer critical
                components. Following the strategy systems throughput and stability were substantially improved
                in a smooth continuous way with neither business interruption nor massive regressions required}
            \item{established transparent scrum-like process with strong ownership and ensured continuous delivery chain.
                It required building the full continuous delivery pipeline and migrating existing legacy code base to
                automatic deployment framework}
            \item{cleaned up old systems and built a new microservice-based set of components leveraging web-scale
                technologies like Redis and Kafka, employing reactive principles with RxJava and doing idempotent scalable
                architecture achieving more than x100 times performance improvements in certain areas}
            \item{established set of strong, mobile and self-organized engineering teams}
